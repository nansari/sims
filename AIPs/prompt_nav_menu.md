You are an expert web developer. Please create a modern, visually appealing, and colorful website navigation bar with the following features by modifying app\templates\base.html :

The top navigation bar should include these menu items: Home, Add, Remove, Update, Attendance, Tasks, Test, Review, Report.

When a navigation item is selected (e.g., Add, Remove, Update), a vertical left-side panel should appear, displaying the relevant submenu items for that section:

Add: User, Batch, Role, Class

Remove: Phone, Address, Call Time, Role

Update: User, Contact, Phone, Batch, Role, Call Time, Mentor, Class

The left vertical panel should include a small left-pointing arrow on its edge. Clicking this arrow should hide (collapse) the panel.

The design must be modern, colorful, and visually engaging.

Use best practices for responsive and accessible web design.

Use your choice of modern web technologies (e.g., React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS).
